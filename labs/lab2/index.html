    <p>Anwers to the question<br><br>

        a. What is the scope of a const variable?<br>
        const keyword is used to declare a constant variable.<br>
        The scope of a const variable in JavaScript is block scope. <br>
        We can only access the const variables in the block, in which it was declared<br>
        We can add or change property 
        but cannot reassign the const 
        object.<br><br>

        b. When were the let and const keywords added to JavaScript?<br>
        let and const keywords were introduced in ES6(2015)<br><br>

        To call the function of arithmetic operations use calculate(a,b) in console<br>
        where a and b can be any number
