## Running the tests

To test the code
1. Visit the lab link
2. Open the console

    If its showing following output then its working: 
    Result after addition : 18
    Result after subtraction : 12
    Result after multiplication : 45
    Result after division : 5

    2. Test the code with any another number and check if operations are correct.
