##Last feedback from TA/Marker
    Overall Feedback
    Overall good!

    The function to calculate the area of a rectangle should accept length and width as its 2 input parameters, but you hard-coded it. -5

    To have good coding practice, put your JS code into a separate file instead of embedding it in your HTML file. -1

##Improvements from last feedback 
According to the last feedback, I seperated script.js in different file and folder
I removed the hard coding way of the areaOfRectangle function, now this function is taking input in console

## Running the tests

To test the code
1. Visit the lab link
2. Open the console
3. Check if its showing this output:
    Area of circle with radius 6 is :113.09723999999999

    To check for arithmetic function:
    1. type calculate(15,3) in console
    If its showing following output then its working: 
    Result after addition : 18
    Result after subtraction : 12
    Result after multiplication : 45
    Result after division : 5

    2. Test the code with any another number and check if operations are correct.


    To check for areaOfRectangle function:
    1. type areaOfRectangle(20,25) in console
    If its showing following output then its working: 
    Area of rectangle with a length of 20, and width of 25 is: 500
