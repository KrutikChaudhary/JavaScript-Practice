## Running the tests

1. Input: 1,2,3,4,5,6

Expected output:
    For Loop: Primes = 3, Composites = 2, Neither = 1


    For Each Loop: Primes = 3, Composites = 2, Neither = 1


    Map: Primes = 3, Composites = 2, Neither = 1


2. Input: 1,23,78,4,5,6
Expected output:
    For Loop: Primes = 2, Composites = 3, Neither = 1


    For Each Loop: Primes = 2, Composites = 3, Neither = 1


    Map: Primes = 2, Composites = 3, Neither = 1


For more testcases try changing the numbers and check the output.
